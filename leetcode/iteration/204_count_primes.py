# 1. Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 to n: (2, 3, 4, â€¦, n).

# 2. Initially, let p equal 2, the first prime number.

# 3. Starting from p2, count up in increments of p and mark each of these
# numbers greater than or equal to p2 itself in the list.
# These numbers will be p(p+1), p(p+2), p(p+3), etc..

# 4. Find the first number greater than p in the list that is not marked.
# If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let p now equal this number (which is the next prime),
# and repeat from step 3.
